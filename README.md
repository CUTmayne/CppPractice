# CppPractice
Practice problems solved using the C++ programming language.

*************

I strongly wish to sharpen my skills in the most efficient way possible,
as the time I have with which I can practice is severely limited,
so I have decided to use C++ for that purpose.
It was recommended to me by one of my online acquaintances.

One of my professors claimed that C++ is difficult to work with in a professional setting. 
I can't verify the accuracy of that opinion,
but I have a background in Java programming which has many syntactic similarities to C++.

Rather than attempting to become fluent in half a dozen languages,
I feel as though it may be more useful to understand thoroughly how to use one language to solve problems.
